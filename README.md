# Lexical Analyzer
This project is a simple command-line application that reads a text file, processes it using a lexer, and prints the resulting tokens. The lexer is responsible for breaking down the input text into meaningful tokens that can be further processed or analyzed.

## Features
- Command-line interface to specify the input text file.
- Reads and validates the input text file.
- Uses a lexer to tokenize the input text.
- Prints the resulting tokens to the console.
## Usage
- To run the application, use ```./Project236 <input_file.txt>```. See ```exampleInputFiles``` for examples.
